# Timothy C. May

This book gathers for the first time the enigmatic cypherpunk, cryptoanarchist, and all-around provocateur Timothy C. May’s most profound, inflammatory, insightful, and clear-cut commentary from his thousands of posts in the Cypherpunk Mailing List, interviews and papers.

## Autobiography

>Whenever I disagree with some of the paranoids and ranters, I am
called a traitor, a hypocrite, a lackey of Eric Hughes, a member of
the "Clique," and on and on.

## Books

## Cryptoanarchy 

#### [Kill ‘em all…I’ll sort ‘em out…](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1998/03/145978eb33c10a5e299faa7c08f939df2eac830540f5b9df9227d29961fca1e8/)

>The screens of freedom must occassionally be refreshed with a GUI-supported blood-color of digital martyrs.

## Cypherpunks

#### [Re: Safe and fun environment?](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1993/10/a1934717cfda007cf90bac79ed0548170f562ad099881014f13b5adcf0301dda/)

>The Cypherpunks agenda [is not] all that clear. I, for example, want to see strong crypto deployed in ways very different than what others favor. Are we to take a majority vote on an agenda, a charter? It's better to just leave the agenda loose and unwritten, so as not to have to grapple with this collision of goals. We can all pretend the agenda is what we favor.

>The [Cypherpunk] movement belongs to what gets written and what gets responded to. In other words, if you want to be listened to, you have to get people's attention by the quality of your arguments. You can't rail against “leaders" like Hal Finney or Duncan Frissell just because their posts get reaction. You can't argue that the "herd" didn't have a chance to vote. In fact, people vote with their own posts. Market democracy.

## Digital Cash

>The failing "War on
Drugs" has already been used to justify many serious abridgements of
basic rights; applying the same logic to creating a cashless society
seems to be the next step.

>...it has long been clear to me that the future of money lies in
electronic form, cryptographically protected. The prolific use of
credit cards for mail-order purchases points to the need for a purely
electronic form of usable money, as do systems like AMIX (which uses
VISA-type credits and debits). The issue is who creates this system,
and what controls exist.
>
>It seems unlikely that the U.S. government will allow "competing
currencies" (one form of digital money, and arguably what we already
have with various tradable financial instruments, which rise and fall
in value depending on various forces) to spring into being, at least
not in forms that are truly like cash.

>If the government controls and sets the protocols for electronic
money, this gives them de facto control over encryption systems and
protocols.  Use of non-approved protocols may be considered ipso facto
proof of money laundering, black marketeering, and tax evasion.

>...if the government creates this cashless society, then the government
will have unprecedented control over nearly all aspects of our lives.
All transactions, no matter how trivial, will be recorded, stored, and
subject to analysis. A complete audit trail of all purchases, food
preferences, entertainment choices, liasons with others, etc., will
exist. This is the concern David Chaum has eloquently raised, and
which he has been dealing with (partially) with his digital money and
untraceable transactions systems.
>
>Furthermore, transactions which are deemed to be politically
incorrect, and there are dozens of obvious examples to choose from,
can be _outlawed_ by the mere typing of a few lines of instructions into
the appropriate data bases. (For example, someone arrested for DUI
tries to buy some beer..."Your transaction cannot be completed. Have a
nice day."  appears on the cash register. Or a pregnant woman--and
under Clinton's computerized health care system this will all be
known--tries to buy some cigarettes....)

>This trend toward a cashless society, controlled by the government,
represents the greatest threat to our libery and our future I can
imagine.
>
>We need to start planning to head this off. Those interested in
"crypto anarchy" as one technological solution are encourage to get in
touch with me.
>
>Make no mistake, a government-run cashless society will be worse that
Orwell's worst.
