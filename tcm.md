# Timothy C. May

## From Anarchy to Welfarism

This <code>in-progress</code> book gathers for the first time the enigmatic cypherpunk, cryptoanarchist, and all-around provocateur Timothy C. May’s most profound, inflammatory, insightful, and clear-cut commentary from his thousands of posts in the Cypherpunk Mailing List, interviews and papers.

## Anarchy

#### [Voluntary Governments?](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1994/08/fc01c984d43ada4687235051e6d69833ce302f3ba7531a53022c64a3285cd255/)

>Without the legal monopoly on coercion, this so-called "government" would
be just another service provider, like Safeway or Goodyear or K-Mart.
Economies of scale work against a large, slow-moving bureaucracy, so the
so-called goverment would devolve quickly into multiple small pieces.
>
>This is the "anarcho-capitalism" many of us argue for, so I won't argue
against it here. I just wouldn't call it "the government" anymore. As soon
as "the government" gives up its use of force, allows competitors in all
areas, and is run by donations or fees, it is no longer "the government."

>I have a problem with the whole notion of calling a voluntary, self-selected, market-driven system a "government" of any kind. Yes, it is something people may voluntarily join, but so are country clubs, book reading groups, and mailing lists. And the decision to shop at Safeway one day is a temporary joining of such an instantiated group. But these things ain't governments This is not just semantic quibbling. If we say that such groups are voluntary, but can vote on "rules" or "laws" which all must follow, then the voluntary nature means people can freely leave, can choose not to abide by the rules, etc. Hence the rules are toothless. There are forms of organization in which bad behavior has implications, such as banishment, shunning, etc. But this is true of the country club, or [the Cypherpunk Mailing List] …acting like a bozo has implications. Some might call these governments of a sort, but I don't. Iceland in the Middle Ages is often cited as such a thing…

>...it is simply poor strategy as well as being poor semantics to label the
voluntary social and economic interactions as being some kind of
"government." Call them what they are: market interactions, agoric systems,
or voluntary associations. Normal life is like this...families, girlfriends
and boyfriends, freedom to associate as one pleases, free markets, anarchy
in book and music selection, etc.
>
>And these systems work pretty well--or at least a lot better than the
corruptions and absurdities of government-run programs. They don't require
that people be "good," only that people understand the consequences of
their actions, the value of a good reputation, and the punishment that will
be meted out to the few who nevertheless transgress against a few basic
rules.
>
>(I mention the need for violence because without some punishment, or
removal by some affordable means, the "wolves" proliferate. To make this
less abstract: no laws except for a very few laws about murder, theft,
rape, etc. Enforce those laws ruthlessly, and the wolf population is kept
in check. a fedback mechanism suppresses wolf formation. Ignore these laws,
delay justice, and proliferate thousands of economic and social laws--such
as the "dietary laws" also known as drug laws--and the wolf population will
proliferate. A feedback mechanism that encourages more wolves to form Look
at inner cities. Look at South-Central L.A.) (No offense meant to wolves or
other predators here.)
>
>And these systems don't have to wait for implementation at some future time
in cyberspace....they already exist all around us.
>
>Just don't call them governments, because they ain't.

>...here's how escrow makes murder contracts
much safer than they are today to negotiate. Instead of one party being
caught in an FBI sting, as is so often the case when amateurs try to
arrange hits, they can use an escrow service to insulate themselves from:
>
>1. From being traced, because the exchanges are handled via pseudonyms
>
>2. From the killer taking the money and then not performing the hit,
because the escrow agent holds the money until the murder is verified
(according to some prototocol, such a newspaper report...again, an area for
more work, thankfully).
>
>3. From being arrested when the money is picked up, as this is all done via
digital cash.
>
>There are some ways to reduce the popularity of this Murder, Incorporated
system.

called a traitor, a hypocrite, a lackey of Eric Hughes, a member of
the "Clique," and on and on.

>Less than 2 years ago I was a homeless person, living on the banks of the San Lorenzo River. Then I met a person named "Timothy C. May." He wasn't interested in being on the Net anymore--he said it took too much of his time--so he gave me his account, his password (which I've since changed, of course), and said ‘Have fun.’

>I promised to mention "private produced law," or PPL. This is the notion
of multiple, competing legal systems. A fictional treatment of this can be
found in Neal Stephenson's novel "Snow Crash," and a more scholarly
treatment can be found in David Friedman's "The Machinery of Freedom" and
in Bruce Benson's "The Enterprise of Law."

## Credentials

>Ask yourself why credentials are
_ever_ needed. Maybe for driving a car, and the like, but in those cases
anonymity is not needed, as the person is in the car, etc.
>
>Credentials for drinking age? Why? Let the parents enforce this, as the
argument goes about watching sex and violence on t.v. (If one accepts the
logic of requiring bars to enforce children's behavior, then one is on a
slippery slope toward requiring television set makers to check smartcards
of viewers, or of requiring a license to access the Internet, etc.)
>
>In almost no cases do I see the need to carry "papers" with me. Maybe a
driver's license, like I said. In other areas, why?
>
>This gets to a core issue: the incredible benefits of locally clearing a
transaction. Caveat emptor, buyer beware, etc. Cash on the barrelhead.

## Cryptoanarchy 

#### [Kill ‘em all…I’ll sort ‘em out…](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1998/03/145978eb33c10a5e299faa7c08f939df2eac830540f5b9df9227d29961fca1e8/)

>The screens of freedom must occassionally be refreshed with a GUI-supported blood-color of digital martyrs.

## Cypherpunks

#### [Re: Safe and fun environment?](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1993/10/a1934717cfda007cf90bac79ed0548170f562ad099881014f13b5adcf0301dda/)

>The Cypherpunks agenda [is not] all that clear. I, for example, want to see strong crypto deployed in ways very different than what others favor. Are we to take a majority vote on an agenda, a charter? It's better to just leave the agenda loose and unwritten, so as not to have to grapple with this collision of goals. We can all pretend the agenda is what we favor.

#### [Re: Safe and fun environment?](http://mailing-list-archive.cryptoanarchy.wiki/archive/1993/10/a1934717cfda007cf90bac79ed0548170f562ad099881014f13b5adcf0301dda/)

>The [Cypherpunk] movement belongs to what gets written and what gets responded to. In other words, if you want to be listened to, you have to get people's attention by the quality of your arguments. You can't rail against “leaders" like Hal Finney or Duncan Frissell just because their posts get reaction. You can't argue that the "herd" didn't have a chance to vote. In fact, people vote with their own posts. Market democracy.

>The issues of taxation, government, anarchy, and
cyberspatial institutions are important topics for a list like
"Cypherpunks." If the *beliefs* are not to be talked about, but only code
is to be written, then _what_ code? Code that helps ensure tax compliance?
Code that helps government control "cyberspace criminals"? We've seen
recent discussions about religion, the need for values, etc. Many of us are
opposed to the specific views raised, but since there is no "official party
line," the way we work on these issues is through discussion.

## Digital Cash

>The failing "War on
Drugs" has already been used to justify many serious abridgements of
basic rights; applying the same logic to creating a cashless society
seems to be the next step.

>...it has long been clear to me that the future of money lies in
electronic form, cryptographically protected. The prolific use of
credit cards for mail-order purchases points to the need for a purely
electronic form of usable money, as do systems like AMIX (which uses
VISA-type credits and debits). The issue is who creates this system,
and what controls exist.
>
>It seems unlikely that the U.S. government will allow "competing
currencies" (one form of digital money, and arguably what we already
have with various tradable financial instruments, which rise and fall
in value depending on various forces) to spring into being, at least
not in forms that are truly like cash.

>If the government controls and sets the protocols for electronic
money, this gives them de facto control over encryption systems and
protocols.  Use of non-approved protocols may be considered ipso facto
proof of money laundering, black marketeering, and tax evasion.

>...if the government creates this cashless society, then the government
will have unprecedented control over nearly all aspects of our lives.
All transactions, no matter how trivial, will be recorded, stored, and
subject to analysis. A complete audit trail of all purchases, food
preferences, entertainment choices, liasons with others, etc., will
exist. This is the concern David Chaum has eloquently raised, and
which he has been dealing with (partially) with his digital money and
untraceable transactions systems.
>
>Furthermore, transactions which are deemed to be politically
incorrect, and there are dozens of obvious examples to choose from,
can be _outlawed_ by the mere typing of a few lines of instructions into
the appropriate data bases. (For example, someone arrested for DUI
tries to buy some beer..."Your transaction cannot be completed. Have a
nice day."  appears on the cash register. Or a pregnant woman--and
under Clinton's computerized health care system this will all be
known--tries to buy some cigarettes....)

>This trend toward a cashless society, controlled by the government,
represents the greatest threat to our libery and our future I can
imagine.

>We need to start planning to head this off. Those interested in
"crypto anarchy" as one technological solution are encourage to get in
touch with me.

Orwell's worst.

substantially less private that banks today in many countries, and is not

>Chaum went to great lengths to develop system which
preserve anonymity for single-spending instances, but which break anonymity
and thus reveal identity for double-spending instances. I'm not sure what
market forces caused him to think about this as being so important, but it
creates many headaches. Besides being clumsy, it require physical ID, it
invokes a legal system to try to collect from "double spenders," and it
admits the extremely serious breach of privacy by enabling stings. For
example, Alice pays Bob a unit of money, then quickly Alice spends that
money before Bob can...Bob is then revealed as a "double spender," and his
identity revealed to whomver wanted it...Alice, IRS, Gestapo, etc. A very
broken idea.

>Is there a danger that people will lose the numbers that they need to
redeem money? That someone could steal the number and thus steal their
money?
>
>Sure. There's the danger that I'll lose my bearer bonds, or forget my Swiss
bank account number, or lose my treasure map to where I buried my money (as
Alan Turing supposedly did in WW II).
>
>People can take steps to limit risk. More secure computers. Dongles worn
around their necks. Protocols that involve biometric authentication to
their local computer or key storage PDA, etc. Limits on withdrawals per
day, etc. People can store key numbers with people they trust, perhaps
encrypted with other keys, can leave them with their lawyers, etc. All
sorts of arrangements can be made.

>Hal is right the problem of *repudiation* or *disavowal* was recognized
early on. Alice is confronted with a digital signature, or whatever. She
says; "But I didn't sign that" or "Oh, that's my old key--it's obsolete" or
"My sysadmin must have snooped through my files," or "I guess those key
escrow guys are at it again."
>
>APPROACHES TO REPUDIATION
>
The purist approach: you *are* your key. If another biological unit
obtains your key, he or she is effectively you. Guard your key carefully.
>
>The modern American "excuse" approach: Hey, if you want to disavow a
contract, like, just claim your key was stolen or, like, you lost it.
>
>I understand the reasoning behind adopting a more intermediate stance, but
I think that only the purist stance will hold water in the long run.(A hint
of this: untraceable cash means, for most transactions of interest with
digital cash, that once the crypto stuff has been handled, whether the sig
was stolen or not is moot, because the money is gone...no court can rule
that the sig was invalid and then retrieve the cash!

## Taxation

"government"...more on this later (and how the idea of "privately-produced
law" figures in).
>
>I'm skeptical that governments would give up their current use of coercion,
or threat of coercion (the fallback position that gives their various
edicts more teeth than, for example, my edicts or your edicts). I'm even
more skeptical that the current bloated state could be funded by the small
fraction of the population that--in my opinion--would make donations. (Mike
has argued elsewhere that his concept is of a utopian state much smaller
than we have today....an even less likely possibility unless that bloated
state is starved to death by the methods many of us advocate...

Hardly. Do the math on how influential any one vote is in an election. For
specific cases, maybe. Again, that's how influence-peddling arises. Not a
very healthy development, even for a cynic like me.
