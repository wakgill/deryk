# About

~~My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low-grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a 15 year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims, like he invented the question mark. Sometimes, he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy – the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical: summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring, we’d make meat helmets. When I was insolent, I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds. Pretty standard, really.~~

## Work 

I have worked or consulted for: Praxis (2014-2018), GS (2012–2014, 2018-2019), Bitcoin.com (2020), Voice & Exit (2016), FEE (2015-2017), Colliers International (2014) and dozens of private clients (2012-). 

My earliest jobs were customer service for an eCommerce site on the weekends when I was in highschool. I hated it but I enjoyed the sexscapades, no doubt exaggerated, the Iraq war veteran who worked the shift with me shared. 

I was briefly a campaign manager for a US congressional race. The candidate was a great guy but I quickly realised I hated campaign politics and left to go build an eBay store selling gun parts. 

That went well and grew quickly, but eBay and DHS began increasingly cracking down on the kinds of products you could sell. Those measures, combined with the revenue ceiling I could never get past ($30k/month) led me to pass that off and I moved to Texas and began doing freelance photography, video work, and graphic design.

Much of that work was me driving around the state taking photos of commercial real-estate properties and creating offer pacakges for the properties in Adobe In-Design. When the real-esate team got sued after I was caught taking photos of property by the owner (the team hadn't disclosed that I needed to be hiding), most of that business blew up.
