# Satoshi and Intellectual Property

TL;DR the claim that Satoshi Nakamoto supported intellectual property in Bitcoin is unsubstantiated by the public evidence
available to us from Satoshi Nakamoto's writings and several times contradicted. While this does not prove that Satoshi did not plan from the start of his work developing Bitcoin to enforce intellectual property claims in the future, we should treat claims like that with skeptiscm and demand primary source proof.

## Source #1: New icon/logo

In a [forum post](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/forum/bitcoin-forum/71/#selection-23.527-23.647) on February 24, 2010, Satoshi announces some new Bitcoin logos and releases these logos into the public domain copyright free. 

```
I release these images into the public domain (copyright-free).  I request that derivative works be made public domain.
```

## Source #2: Idea for file hosting and proxy services

In a [forum post](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/forum/bitcoin-forum/87/#selection-23.794-23.1137) on March 15, 2010, Satoshi asks speculates that it a file hosting site that acceepts Bitcoin payments would be very useful, and that this service would ideally be in the public domain.

```
It would be nice if we made some free PHP code for an image and file hosting service that charges Bitcoins.  Anyone with some extra bandwidth quota could throw it on their webserver and run it.  Users could finally pay the minor fee to cover bandwidth cost and avoid the limits and hassles.  Ideally, it should be MIT license or public domain.
```

## Source #3: Re: More BitCoin questions

In an [email](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/emails/mike-hearn/10/#selection-27.423-2.8) reply to Mike Hearn on January 07, 2011, Satoshi asks Mike about his work on a client-only implentation of Bitcoin.

```
The first client-only implementation will really start to move things to the next step.  Is it going to be open source, or Google proprietary?
```

Mike replies that he is indeed planning to open source the work and Satoshi [writes](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/emails/mike-hearn/11/#selection-25.164-25.257) back:

```
Perfect.  Once your code shows how to simplify it down, other authors can follow your lead.  
```

## Source #4: Re: Open sourced my Java SPV impl

In an [email](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/emails/mike-hearn/13/#selection-27.691-27.835) reply to Mike Hearn on March 09, 2009, Satoshi writes that it is "great" that Mike was able to open source his Java SPV implementation.
