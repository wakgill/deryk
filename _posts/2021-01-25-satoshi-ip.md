# Satoshi and Intellectual Property

TL;DR the claim that Satoshi Nakamoto supported intellectual property in Bitcoin is unsubstantiated by the public evidence
available to us from Satoshi Nakamoto's writings and several times contradicted. While this does not prove that Satoshi did not plan from the start of his work developing Bitcoin to enforce intellectual property claims in the future, we should treat claims like that with skeptiscm and demand primary source proof.

In an [email](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/emails/mike-hearn/10/#selection-27.423-2.8) reply to Mike Hearn on January 07, 2011, Satoshi asks Mike about his work on a client-only implentation of Bitcoin.

>The first client-only implementation will really start to move things to the next step.  Is it going to be open source, or Google proprietary?

Mike replies that he is indeed planning to open source the work and Satoshi [writes](https://wakgill.github.io/bitcoin-archive/docs/emails/mike-hearn/11/#selection-25.164-25.257) back:

>Perfect.  Once your code shows how to simplify it down, other authors can follow your lead.
